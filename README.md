Mimic the super-admin "Skip Confirmation Email" checkbox for regular users.

== Description ==
When working in a WordPress MultiSite Network, users with Admin/Editor level access can create new users if enabled but they lack the "Skip Confirmation Email" toggle that Super Admins have which allows them to add the user without sending an email that requires their confirmation.

PS: After adding a new user you'll still see this message on screen: "Invitation email sent to new user. A confirmation link must be clicked before their account is created."

== Installation ==
Upload the MultiSite New User, No Confirmation plugin to your blog, activate it.
